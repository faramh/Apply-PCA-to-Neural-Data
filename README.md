# Apply PCA to Neural Data
Project Overview
This project explores the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on neural electrophysiological data collected from a macaque monkey. The primary objective is to reduce the dimensionality of the high-dimensional neural data while preserving the most significant patterns of neural activity.

Background
Neural electrophysiological data, particularly from primates, is often high-dimensional and complex, making it challenging to interpret directly. PCA is a powerful technique that helps in identifying the underlying structure of the data by reducing its dimensionality, enabling more accessible analysis and visualization of key neural activity patterns.

Methodology
Data Collection: The neural data used in this project was obtained from a macaque monkey during a controlled experimental task. The data includes multi-channel recordings of neural activity.

Data Preprocessing: Before applying PCA, the data underwent several preprocessing steps, including filtering, spike sorting, and noise reduction. These steps were crucial to ensure that the input data was clean and ready for dimensionality reduction.

PCA Application: PCA was applied to the preprocessed neural data. The goal was to extract the principal components that capture the most variance in the data, thereby simplifying the complexity of neural activity into a smaller set of variables.

Analysis and Interpretation: The principal components were analyzed to identify the key patterns of neural activity. The results were visualized to illustrate how PCA can highlight significant features in the data, which may correspond to specific neural processes or responses.

Results
The application of PCA provided insights into the dominant patterns of neural activity, revealing correlations and structures that are not easily discernible in the raw high-dimensional data. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the neural dynamics involved in the experimental task.
